# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Short version: please report security issues by emailing security@maykinmedia.nl.**

If you discover security issues in Open Inwoner or related projects under the same
organization, we request you to disclose these in a *responsible* way by e-mailing to
security@maykinmedia.nl.

It is extremely useful if you have a reproducible test case and/or clear steps on how to
reproduce the vulnerability.

Please do not report security issues on the public Github issue tracker, as this makes
it visible which exploits exist before a fix is available, potentially comprising a lot
of unprotected instances.

Once youâ€™ve submitted an issue via email, you should receive an acknowledgment from a
member of the security team as soon as possible, and depending on the action to be taken,
you may receive further followup emails.
