    Creating a row of buttons. This expects buttons inside of the component.
    This is only a wrapper to make sure that the buttons are displayed correctly.

    Variables:
        - align: enum[right] | if the buttons should be aligned left (no align should be given) or alinged right side.
        - mobile: booleam | If the button row should only be displayed on mobile screens.

    Extra context:
        - contents: string (HTML) | this is the context between the button_row and endbutton_row tags
